## 2026-08-13 — M0 walking skeleton: built, reviewed, green

**The skeleton walks.** `mvo init → intent new → race → explain → audit` works end-to-end on the toy fixture: two candidate worlds from scripted patches, a suite oracle per world, a pure decision function that SELECTs the passing candidate, and an audit that replays every decision from the hash-chained ledger byte-for-byte — and fails loudly when a ledger byte is flipped.

**How it was built** (all agent-built, human-supervised, in one 70-minute pipeline):
- **Go-vs-Rust bake-off** (same storage-core spec, one agent each, judge re-ran both suites + a 10-case cross-implementation canonicalization probe): both implementations passed everything; canonical bytes were byte-identical across languages in 9/10 edge cases. **Verdict: narrow Go win** (clarity, test quality; Rust's minimal-dep constraint forced ~45 lines of hand-rolled hex/date code). One Rust idea back-ported: reject floats in canonical JSON per DP-1. PRD's Go default stands, now with evidence.
- **Build**: storage (object/cas/ledger) → engine (gitx/oracle/race/workspace) ∥ CLI (cmd/mvo + toyrepo fixture + acceptance script) → integrator (module compiled clean on first assembly).
- **Adversarial review**: 2 reviewers, 14 real findings — best catches: `mvo audit` printed OK even when replay diverged; `VerifyChain` couldn't detect deleted tail rows (fixed: seq contiguity + AUTOINCREMENT high-water cross-check); `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_INDEX_FILE` env leakage into gitx subprocesses; worktree path collisions across races. All fixed, 4 skips with written justification.
- Full gate verified independently after the workflow: `gofmt` / `go vet` / `go test ./...` (8 packages) / `scripts/m0-accept.sh` — all green.

**M0 exit criterion status**: audit-replay determinism ✅ (acceptance step 4 copies the workspace to a second location and replays). Remaining M0 items are the human-gated week-1 tasks below.

## 2026-08-13 — M0 kickoff

**Done today:**
- Project scaffolding: Go module (`github.com/coagente/multiverso`), Apache-2.0 LICENSE, DCO contributing policy, CI (build/vet/fmt/test), this build log.
- [M0 design doc](docs/design/M0.md): object schemas, ledger/CAS contracts, CLI verbs, acceptance script for the walking skeleton.
- Week-1 checklist progress:
  - [x] GitHub custom-ref durability probe → [docs/probes/github-custom-refs.md](docs/probes/github-custom-refs.md) — 1.2k refs fine; **finding**: GitHub's attestation store rejects self-signed bundles (tlog inclusion required) → mirror is v1+, git stays canonical
  - [x] Go-vs-Rust agent bake-off → narrow Go win, see entry above
  - [ ] **Needs Karim**: claim package names (`multiverso` + `mvo` on crates.io / PyPI / npm) — requires account credentials
  - [ ] **Needs Karim**: commission trademark knockout search for "MULTIVERSO", classes 9/42
  - [ ] **Needs Karim**: design-partner recruitment (target ≥1 committed partner by end of M0)

**M0 scope** (from [PRD §12](PRD.md)): ledger + CAS + intent/world objects + T0 worktree worlds + one oracle + `mvo race` with N=2 scripted patches (no agents yet). Exit: `mvo audit` replays a toy race deterministically.

## 2026-08-12 → 13 — Research + PRD

- 20-chapter research corpus (305 primary sources), 13/13 founding-memo claims verified against primary sources.
- PRD v1.0 approved for development after a 3-lens adversarial review panel (30 findings, all dispositioned).
- Headline: nobody ships >2 of Multiverso's 5 capabilities; the white space is the evidence-aware scheduler; window ~12–24 months.
